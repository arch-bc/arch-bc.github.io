title: ENERGY EFFICIENCY MEASURES
permalink: /energy/
desc:
  I have undertaken a course and obtained a government approved qualification in energy efficiency for older and traditional buildings. The course looked at the various issues when considering energy efficiency improvements in all buildings of traditional construction and this is particularly relevant to Listed Buildings.<br><br>

  A holistic approach should be applied, meaning addressing issues such as the buildingâ€™s condition; assessing existing environmental conditions around the property; and understanding its construction, to ensure that technically compatible materials and solutions are used and follow recognised conservation best practice.<br><br>

  The course also touched on the application of PAS2035 in respect of retrofitting dwellings for improved energy efficiency and the additional considerations that need to be taken into account, when looking at traditionally constructed buildings in particular.<br><br>

  Please contact us if you require an initial consultation.

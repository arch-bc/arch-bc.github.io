   While the site is adjacent to a listed building, this was a slightly atypical commission for me, although involved elements of new design aesthetics and sustainable building materials; both of which I have used in the historic environment context.<br><br>
   I worked closely with a property owner to help them modify and partially redesign an existing scheme for a new dwelling.  I subsequently re-applied for and attained planning permission for the revised design.<br><br>
   I then developed the approved planning drawings for Building Regulations, working with an independent Approved Inspector to attain Plans approval.  The design involved a number of sustainable construction elements, including sedum roofing and wood fibre wall insulation, which necessitated careful detailing and periodic technical liaison with the client, who was a self-builder.<br><br>
   My 3D design model was particularly useful, not only in communicating the changes and initial re-design concepts to the client and planners, but also when communicating with the client, structural engineer and steel fabricator, during the design and manufacture of the buildingâ€™s steel frame.<br><br>
   The scheme has recently been completed on site.<br><br>
   Project reference code 145.

   A Grade II listed, late 15th/Early 16th century timber frame house. The property has a 19th century rear extension and alterations by the notable Arts & Crafts architect Philip Webb, for William Morrisâ€™ sister, Henrietta. The design of the rear extension contains some interesting features such as a fully glazed roof section above a large window, designed to provide better natural light for Henrietta's needlework. in 1877 William Morris and Philip Webb wrote the manifesto for the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings that, as a member, we still support today.<br><br>
   I attained listed building consent for the current owner for the replacement of some modern external doors and the installation of a conservation rooflight and mechanical extract ventilation in the bathroom. While the extent of my commission was fairly minor in scale, it was great to work on a building of such a prominent and influential architect and with a direct connection to two building conservation pioneers.<br><br>
   Project reference code 157.

      When I first visited this Grade 2 listed cottage it had been poorly modernised and altered in the mid 20th century, using modern materials not compatible with historic building conservation.<br><br>
      The owner had contacted me regarding renovations to create a family home. However, the initial works looked to resolve dampness in the living room make repairs to the dangerous chimney stack. This led to a listed building consent approval to remove a later inserted fireplace and to open up an older inglenook fireplace - which assisted with the drying out of the building.<br><br>
      After a more detailed inspection, I discovered the cottage contained some interesting vernacular features in addition to its timber frame. These included a bread oven, old floor pavers, a section of pargetting and wattle & daub infill panels.<br><br>
      I then worked closely with the client and the local authority conservation officer to develop a renovation and extension scheme and attained planning permission and listed building consent.<br><br>
      The works included repairs and conservation to the building’s historic core. This included removing the cementitious render and replacing it with a lime one; upgrading the insulation using natural vapour permeable materials; and the replacement of modern patten windows. The scheme resolved circulation issues, provided an additional bedroom, a larger kitchen, and increased living space overlooking the garden.<br><br>
      Following the clearing of various planning conditions attached to the approvals regarding joinery details and archaeology, I then developed planning drawings for Building Regulation plans approval. I worked closely with a third-party firm of structural engineers to design the extension as an independent structure to the historic core - as well as designing a new timber frame structure to the extension.<br><br>
      The owner project managed and oversaw the extension construction and refurbishment work themselves - although they did subsequently require an additional construction detail of the extension roof structure and insulation.<br><br>
      It was a pleasure to work with the owner, helping them to bring their cottage into good repair and create a family home - this will also assist in the cottage’s conservation long-term.<br><br>

      A 19th century wing to a 17th Century building formally used as a school, and subsequently divided into multiple dwellings.  The property is listed Grade II.  This project shows how sometimes the buildings listed protection can extend to fixtures within it.      The Parish Council appointed me to advise them on the replacement of the sand:cement render with a lime based render.<br><br>
      The client looked to refit a dated kitchen.  In the process they uncovered a large, fairly dilapidated cast iron range. This had been concealed within a fireplace and by modern fitted cupboards. They had hoped to remove it, however, an LBC refusal - prepared by a separate architectural firm - was upheld at a subsequent appeal.<br><br>
      I attained Listed Building Consent for a revised scheme to build the new kitchen design around it including lower the ceiling to accommodate ventilation and other services and internal alterations to form a new WC, boot room and utility space.<br><br>
      Project reference code 135.

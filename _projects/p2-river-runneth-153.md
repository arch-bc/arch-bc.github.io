    I was appointed to undertake a full structural survey of a Grade II listed farmhouse in rural Essex.<br><br>
    When inspecting an outbuilding at the rear of the site, I found within the stairwell down to the cellar, intact wattle and daub (e.g. infill panels made from made from mud straw applied onto a lattice of branches), covered with haired lime plaster and carpenters marks; fairly typical for a property dating from the 17 Century. I also found water running freely and continuously from one corner of the cellar. I have come across wells within properties but had not effectively seen a water course within a building before.<br><br>
    Channels had been cut into the floor pavers. And some pavers had been lifted and an area excavated. And a modern pre-formed polypropylene inspection chamber base tray had been positioned in the bottom of the excavation. This was connected to an out-flow pipe through the rear wall. Water constantly flowed into the tray from within the cellar and around the out-flow pipework opening in the wall.<br><br>
   The owner had replaced the existing adjacent sump and pump with a tray connected to the surface water drainage, discharging into the garden. Technically both would constitute alterations to the property and should have received Listed Building Consent. There is no statutory limitation for prosecution for unauthorised alterations to a listed building. Being unsure consent had been sought I advised the purchaser to discuss this with their legal advisors.<br><br>
    The property is in a valley, near to a river in area containing several natural springs – so the source of water within the basement could be down to a natural spring. Another possibility was a leak from the mains supply, this being adjacent to the water ingress to the cellar.<br><br>
    Although particularly damp, even for a cellar, the “stream” of water was draining away satisfactorily and did not appear to be adversely affecting the structure of the building. I measured a high moister content in the floor joists and timbers embedded into the walls. In the long term this will make them more prone to the mechanisms of decay (e.g. rot and beetle attack)..<br><br>
    I advised, subject to confirmation on the water source, that works be undertaken to improve the environmental conditions and help the building’s long term conservation. Project reference code 153.

 This Grade II listed, timber frame and thatched cottage, was formally three workhouse dwellings and dates from the 18th century. The property was altered and substantially renovated to a single dwelling in the middle of the 20th Century.<br><br>
 I helped the owner attain three separate listed building consents. The first was for extensive repairs to the timber frame and removal of previous cementitious mortar “repairs”.  The view of the Conservation Officer was the extent of the work went beyond the scope of “repair” and were “alterations” thus requiring prior consent.<br><br>
 A common issue with multiple dwellings ‘knocked-into-one’ can be problems with layout and internal horizontal and vertical circulation around the property. The following two LBC approvals were for alterations to the internal layout to improve the flow through the building by changing the uses of some rooms, opening up some spaces and reversing an existing modern staircase.<br><br>

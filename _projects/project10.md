title: Busy Masonry Bees
permalink: /project10/
desc:
    When inspecting an outbuilding at the rear of a Grade II listed cottage in Essex, some areas of masonry were repointed using hard cementitious mortar.  This had caused the relatively soft bricks to erode and I recommended that the cementitious mortar should be carefully removed and replaced with a lime based mortar.  This is a fairly common defect however more unusually I found that some of the brickwork joints had Masonry Bee cavities.<br><br>
    Some of the cavities ran along bed joints and appear to be fairly deep, however, did not appear to be affecting the performance or durability of the brickwork.<br><br>
    The bees are opportunists and will re-use old nest sites.  They are solitary insects and, like wildlife generally, are efficient pollinators.  I therefore advised my client that wall should be periodically monitored and should it start to deteriorate the cavities can be repointed with a compatible lime based mortar.<br><br>
    Artificial nesting boxes can also be placed on or near to help entice bees away from the masonry cavities and prevent recolonisation. These can be home-made or, alternatively, proprietary kits are available.<br><br>
    Project reference code 147.
